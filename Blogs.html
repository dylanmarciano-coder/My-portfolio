        <h2> How I learned how to create my first website using HTML and CSS </h2>

        <h3> Learning how to use HTML for the first time was quite difficult and overwhelming for me
             since I had only learned how to code using C++ and a little bit of Java
             at the time.
        </h3>

        <h3> Once I had overcome that first few hours of learning, I was slowly finding it easier and easier
             to code using HTML, although it was still quite new to me, the important part was that the basics
             were beginning to become easier and easier for me to understand.
        </h3>

        <h3> Nowadays, I still have a bit of trouble here and there remembering how to do different commands, I
             I can confidently say that I more experienced at coding using HTML than I was before, and I hope to
             continue learning more things and hone the skills I already have.

        <h2> My challenges starting off in Computer Programming </h2>

        <h3> Starting Computer Programming very difficult for me. As a STEM student during my Grade 11 and 12, I 
             was expecting us to learn at least the basics of coding, or something adjacent to it. But to my dismay,
             we did not do such things. We primarily focused on mathematics and different sciences like geology and physics.
        </h3>

        <h3> All these being said, I was very intimidated by coding, without any background or any sort of knowledge on how to do it,
             I had always viewed it as an enigma, something that I was very interested in, but also something I had zero undertanding of.
        </h3>

        <h3> Our first meeting in the Computer Programming course on confirmed my fear, that I was going to be like fish out of water
             beside my classmates. All the different terminologies were vague to me, and all the information was making me doubt my 
             capabilities to continue on with the Computer Science course as a whole. But I knew I had to keep pushing, to push past my
             fears and doubts and move forward. From there, I began learning more about C++ through our different assignments, and slowly
             refine my coding skills more and more with each week that passes until I finally became confident with my coding skills.
